# vue

## Setup

On a linux/mac, once you have the docker whale running, the terminal works just fine.

On windows, there is "docker quickstart" that pops a command line tool that seems to work fine.

## Use

After setup, `. context` in the root project should set your path.

After this, the dev tools,

`vue` ... => vue-docker vue ...
`node` ... => vue-docker node ...
`npm` ... => vue-docker npm ...
`yarn` ... => vue-docker yarn ...

`vue-docker` command...

runs a comand within the vue


Start mongo:

docker-compose -f stack.yml up
